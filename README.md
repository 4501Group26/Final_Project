# Final_Project
Our goal of the project is utilizing Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2009 through June 2015 with local historical weather data to gain insight toward relationships among these data. 
## Part1: Data Processing
We calculated the distance by converting latitude and longitude into kms and processed Taxi and Uber, and weather data.
## Part2: Storing Cleaned Data
In this part, we created sql tables and added data to databases.
## Part3: Gaining Insight toward Data
We wrote 7 queries to files and gained some results from writteb queries.
## Part4: Visualizing Data
We utilized Pandas, matplotlib, and other packages to visualize data to find patterns and relationships.
